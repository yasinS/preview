### üìù Preview (this project)
[**Preview**](https://github.com/yasinS/preview) is a simple web-based Markdown editor with a selection of helpful features. This app can be used both locally and offline, so it may be useful to clone the repo and open `index.html` on your system. No information is transmitted nor account functionality offered ‚Äì this is not a server-side project.

This project contains some custom-written code and extensions, so I'm particularly interested in whether you can achieve XSS via a **Markdown payload**, or otherwise, in the context of `yasins.github.io` (e.g. DOM or reflected XSS).

 * Physical testing and social engineering attacks
