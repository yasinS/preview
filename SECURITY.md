# üîí Reporting security issues

* If you believe you've found a security issue, you are encouraged to file a report.
* Please send the report in an email to **security@ysx-contact.com**.
* Thank you for contributing towards the security of this project.

# Policy 
## Disclosure policy
I will investigate submitted reports and make every effort to quickly resolve vulnerabilities in my "In Scope" projects. Please make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of any asset.

### üìù Preview (this project)
[**Preview**](https://github.com/yasinS/preview) is a simple web-based Markdown editor with a selection of helpful features. This app can be used both locally and offline, so it may be useful to clone the repo and open `index.html` on your system. No information is transmitted nor account functionality offered ‚Äì this is not a server-side project.

This project contains some custom-written code and extensions, so I'm particularly interested in whether you can achieve XSS via a **Markdown payload**, or otherwise, in the context of `yasins.github.io` (e.g. DOM or reflected XSS).
